# Oompa-Loompa Swap

Chrome extension that replaces "AI" and "artificial intelligence" with
"Oompa-Loompas", and "AGI" with "GOL" on LinkedIn.

Inspired by [this LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sevinf_roald-dahl-creator-of-charlie-and-the-chocolate-share-7421521052595523585-hzPw/).

## Build

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

Load the extension in Chrome using "Load unpacked" and select `dist`.
